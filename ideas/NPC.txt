NPC

sprite

- always an upper part = 14x8   : peopleHead_plus_mask
- always a lower part = 14x8    : peopleFeet_plus_mask
- sometimes blinking eyes = 4x8 : eyesBlinking (for now only 1 type)

characteristics

- x-Coordinate
- y-Coordinate
- Type : combination of heads,feet,eyes (going for more than 16 combinations)
- active (not in every house,tree an NPC is present)

2 different locations possible

Interrior (npc.type depends on variable player.lastDoor, the last door a player has passed)
- every shop
- every Inn
- some houses
- some trees

on the map
- unique npc's for each location

interrogate
- each NPC has its own text
- 3 possibel types:
	- give information
	- ask a question (find me this, want to sleep)
	- trigger a list of items (buy , sell)
- triggering field of interrogation should be bigger than the sprite (32x32) and like this

####			#OO#		O sprite part
#### + 	OO	=	#OO#		# interrogation field
####	OO		####
####			####

Collision
- obviously you should not be able to walk over NPC's. A 16x16 square should do.
