No longer select destination for doors.

Changed the way doors work.
- Only place EXTERIOR doors and link to the inside.
- Exterior doors must link to an interior, not the other way around.
Fixed bug preventing tiles from exporting towards the end of the tileset.

Added Door object exportation.
- 1) Create an object with the door sub-image.

- 4) Save and export!

1/12/2017:
Added tile shifts in the Tile Editor to shift every solid tile of every chunk.

1/9/2017:
